35;Thank you both for leaving the basement lights on. And it reeks in here like skunk;12/03/11 22:41 
1;Hey sir I have a question on software I am doing that timeline for john but I am trying name the identity the guys name for a event and the next event ha;04/04/11 14:40 
1;s the same guys name as the first but it will not let me to name the second identity the same as the first identity is there a way around that or some;04/04/11 14:40 
1;thing that I have to do to allow me to do it;04/04/11 14:40 
1;The identity field must be unique, but you can use label instead;04/04/11 14:41 
1;Ok thank u sir;04/04/11 14:42 
1;Go to item properties and select label;04/04/11 14:42 
1;Ok kewl;04/04/11 14:42 
1;Is there a way to copy the entire event and paste it for the next?;04/04/11 14:43 
1;Should be able to copy an paste anything on the chart, yes;04/04/11 14:44 
1;Hmmm it will not allow me to I right click on the event hit copy and right click else where on the timeline and hit paste it just rehighlights the event ;04/04/11 14:48 
1;I was trying to duplicate;04/04/11 14:48 
1;I think it duplicates in that exact physical location ;04/04/11 14:49 
1;See if it is stacked on other one;04/04/11 14:49 
1;I tried to click on the top one and change the date and time but if it is stacking it moves the entire stack to that location then;04/04/11 14:50 
1;Hmm guess u may have to recreate it then;04/04/11 14:50 
1;Wait I remember how;04/04/11 14:51 
1;Ok not a problem just checking;04/04/11 14:51 
1;U copy it to a new chart, change the identity, then copy it back into your chart;04/04/11 14:52 
1;Ok I'll give that a shot thank u;04/04/11 14:52 
1;Yup;04/04/11 14:53 
1;Yep that worked if the time increments are to close and it stacks the events on top of each other how do u spread them out?;04/04/11 14:56 
1;Got it you have to drag with the arrow not the hand;04/04/11 15:00 
1;Yes or unpinned them;04/04/11 15:10 
1;Question when there are two people arguing would you show two different event bubbles and link them together with the description of the event;04/04/11 15:12 
1;An argument is one event with two or more involved (linked) subjects;04/04/11 15:17 
1;Last dance with mary jane tonight, u in? Gotta pass a piss test in a couple months so this be it for while;04/04/11 15:21 
1;People should not be events;04/04/11 15:28 
1;He should be entered as a regular entity ;04/04/11 15:28 
1;So when it shows me the male figure or female figure I shouldnt use that? What should I use?;04/04/11 15:30 
1;Yes, but if u look at tabs the male and female can be events or other entity types;04/04/11 15:36 
1;There are tabs above the icons;04/04/11 15:37 
1;Ok so can I make the main person the event and then just add the associate under it almost like it is now but change the event below to a associate?;04/04/11 15:38 
1;No I would only make incidents events;04/04/11 15:39 
1;Make people standard entities and link them to events;04/04/11 15:39 
1;Regular entities don't appear in squares ;04/04/11 15:41 
1;U only see the icon;04/04/11 15:41 
1;Because people will be linked to multiple events;04/04/11 15:41 
1;Ok so I shouldn't make the events with people how should I represent the event title and photo? Do u have a example that I can look off of to get an idea?;04/04/11 15:42 
1;Ok;04/04/11 15:42 
1;Or u can make him a timeline if he is linked to all the events;04/04/11 15:42 
1;Ok so I should just make one associate and link then to all the different events;04/04/11 15:42 
1;Hang on;04/04/11 15:42 
1;Not quite all of them;04/04/11 15:43

1;Ok thank you sir;04/05/11 11:15 
1;Question for ya sir I am not 100% sure on how to make it look nice I tried the premade template for the layouts it just makes it look worse or do I just ;04/05/11 15:20 
1;have to mess with it by adjusting one by one?;04/05/11 15:20 
1;Yup, sucks;04/05/11 15:20 
1;Dam that is a lot of adjusting how do u not make it look like a mess of lines just spread it out?;04/05/11 15:21 
1;But wait. What version do u have?;04/05/11 15:37 
1;Lol very carefully, or u take it off the timeline and space everything yourself;04/05/11 15:38 
1;Version 8.5.1 and I think I will spend sometime spreading it lol last thing I want is a day and a half gone;04/05/11 15:39 
1;Did you put subjects above and below the timeline if not do u think that it will not not look good if I did?;04/05/11 16:00 
1;That is probably fine;04/05/11 16:04 
1;Ok timelines are kind of a pain to do with all the different connections and being able to move it all around;04/05/11 16:05 
1;Edit the objects and set them all to free;04/05/11 16:05 
1;Then u can move them yourself;04/05/11 16:06 
1;Ok I'll give it a shot;04/05/11 16:06

63;How do doe's students hit his server;12/05/11 21:26

63;Lemme know if u get it up... ill respond to emails;12/05/11 22:20 
63;Trying to see if my efforts paid off. Yes. I am in the database.;12/05/11 22:23 
63;You need to send request to hostmaster asking for VPN access.;12/05/11 22:26 
1;How did u get passed the data loss when you try to print it out on the plotter;04/06/11 10:12 
1;Export as A3 or some other smaller paper type as a PDF. Print the PDF using adobe.;04/06/11 10:12 
1;Will take away from the quality of the print?;04/06/11 10:15 
1;Will that*;04/06/11 10:15 
1;Not much. It makes high quality PDFs ;04/06/11 10:16 
1;Ok I'll give it a shot thank u;04/06/11 10:16 
1;How do I shrink down the chart with out bringing down the font size? Right now it is 82 x 30 it's big;04/06/11 12:32 
1;You just shrink it then blow it up as PDF to print it;04/06/11 12:33 
1;Resolution is good;04/06/11 12:33 
1;So do I have to go through all the font sizes and shrink them down to fit on a smaller page size or can I make it do that automatically?;04/06/11 12:34 
1;Have you tried to call them for trouble support?;04/06/11 12:54 
1;Yes;04/06/11 13:26 
1;They couldn't do it either lol;04/06/11 13:26 
1;No it shrinks it for you in page setup;04/06/11 13:27 
1;U tell it to fit to whatever paper size and it will;04/06/11 13:27 
1;Then export as PDF ;04/06/11 13:28 
1;Ok I think I found the problem for the export for me I have it set to custom 1 82x30 but everytime it exports as a PDF it defaults the custom 1 back to 8;04/06/11 13:29 
1;.5x11 so I am going to see if I can't change the default printer size to the 82x30;04/06/11 13:29 
1;It shows them PDF writer as a printer so does it select the options from there instead of the plotter? If so it would not recognize my custom setting for t;04/06/11 13:31 
1;he plotter;04/06/11 13:31 
1;Yep I think that is it;04/06/11 13:32 
1;It shows me the paper sizes that it will export but I can not change any of them it just gives me a error when I try;04/06/11 13:33 
1;It will not export a large PDF. Legal 11x17 or standard only;04/06/11 13:36 
1;U just blow it up in adobe;04/06/11 13:36 
1;Resolution is actually fine;04/06/11 13:36 
1;I understand that but I am trying to make it where there isn't a foot of white on top of the chart then the time bar. It will allow me to export on the p;04/06/11 13:40 
1;redesignated size paper but it will not allow me to do it with a custom size.;04/06/11 13:40 
1;No custom sizes no;04/06/11 13:41 
1;Why?;04/06/11 13:42 
1;Cuz it sucks;04/06/11 13:42 
1;But u can tell it to fit in that size in page setup;04/06/11 13:42 
1;Ok is there a way to cut out the big blank area?;04/06/11 13:42 
1;I got that;04/06/11 13:43 
1;Move the chart up towards the top edge;04/06/11 13:43 
1;Then all the runoff will be on the bottom;04/06/11 13:43 
1;Ok I'll give that a shot. Do u just deselect the center on page option and select everything and move it?;04/06/11 13:44 
1;Yup;04/06/11 13:45 
1;Ok;04/06/11 13:45 
1;Thank u;04/06/11 13:45

40;I was going to text you today and find out what the plan for saturday was;11/10/11 07:56 
40;I have free tickets to take the kids to school's learning center to see a laser light show. It starts at 6:45 pm. I want to be there no later than 6:15 so we can ensure we have seats together as the room is not that big. If you want to drop them off early, i am ok with that. Just let me know what time. You can have a night to do whatever you want. I just need clothes for them on Sunday so i can also get their pictures done.;11/10/11 08:08 
40;Sounds like a fun time!  when did you want me to drop them off?;11/10/11 09:10 
40;By four maybe. That way i can feed them first.;11/10/11 09:29 
40;Ok, might be a little early if that's ok;11/10/11 09:30 
40;Sure. Sounds good. I rhink the kids will like this show. Only 45 minutes long so we won't be out late.;11/10/11 09:34 
40;Cool, I think they will be impressed;11/10/11 09:36 
40;Hope so.;11/10/11 10:48

43;Sounds like you need another consult.  Why remove any of it with no cancer?;01/04/12 19:52 
43;There were so many lesions and pockets that was contributing to his copd that it was difficult to get to the sections that needed to be biopsied. The doctor said he removed only what he had to. They were only going for the upper 1/3 of the right lung.;01/04/12 19:55

53;She is sitting up, but has been asleep since we got here.  She is very confused, doesnt make sense much when talking. Doc is supposed to b on his way to talk to;03/04/12 11:33

53;That will be fine. That is why i have not come up there. I know your mom does not care for all that attention when she is not feeling well. She needs her rest, not frustration and agitated by visitors.;03/04/12 11:43

33;Ok. We went to apple orchard. They had dog bones. I will send picture of package.;09/09/12 16:19

28;Cool do I need to bring the charger with it?;09/09/12 18:13 
28;Yeah prolly a good idea;09/09/12 18:14 
28;Ok that's the only piece of the puzzle I have to figure out since the laptop is now hidden but the charger is still on the table..  She thinks her parent;09/09/12 18:16 
28;s accidentally packed it and took it back to TN;09/09/12 18:16 
28;Nice! You can bring it without if need be, so long as it has a decent battery life and is charged;09/09/12 18:17 
28;But best to have it since I will need to move all the old data back over. Also having the install disk will speed up the process;09/09/12 18:18 
28;Yes I will figure out a way to get it out of the house. The battery life on this thing is not good at all (I think it's on it's 3rd battery? But that one;09/09/12 18:20 
28; is still a couple years old).;09/09/12 18:20 
28;Yeah def get it then, install disk too ideally;09/09/12 18:21 
28;The original disk plus any upgrade if relevant;09/09/12 18:21
